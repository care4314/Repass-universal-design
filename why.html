        <h3>The internet is infrastructure now</h3>
        <p>
          We rely on websites to apply for jobs, attend classes, schedule
          appointments, and stay connected. When a site is not accessible, it
          can keep people out of the same opportunities that others
          receive by default.

        <h3>Disability is normal, not rare</h3>
        <p>
          Disability is part of the human experience. Some disabilities are
          permanent, some are temporary, and some are situational:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Permanent examples: Blindness, low vision, deafness, limited mobility.</li>
          <li>Temporary examples: A broken arm, a concussion, eye surgery.</li>
          <li>Situational examples: Bright sunlight on a phone screen, holding a baby,
              trying to read on a noisy bus, or dealing with ADHD brain fog.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When we design only for people with no current disabilities, we leave out a
          huge portion of real life.

        <h3>Accessibility improves usability for everyone</h3>
        <p>
          Design choices like clear headings, good color contrast, large tap
          targets, and readable language are essential for many people with
          disabilities. They also help tired students on their phones at
          midnight and power users navigating quickly with a keyboard. Universal
          Design makes the experience smoother for everyone, not just those who have disabilities.

      <article class="content-section">
        <h3>Legal and professional reality</h3>
        <p>
          In many places, digital accessibility is considered a civil right.
          Organizations are expected to meet standards like the Web Content
          Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), and lawsuits around inaccessible
          websites are becoming more common. For developers and designers,
          accessibility is part of being a professional, not an optional bonus.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="content-section">
        <h3>Accessible does not mean boring</h3>
        <p>
          There is a myth that accessible sites are plain or “locked down.” In
          practice, accessible design tends to be cleaner, more consistent, and
          easier to understand. Strong contrast, clear hierarchy, and thoughtful
          motion can still feel modern and “hip” while remaining usable for a
          wide range of people.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article class="content-section">
        <h3>Every design choice includes or excludes someone</h3>
        <p>
          Each decision we make as designers and developers either opens the
          door wider or makes it harder for someone to participate. Not
          designing for Universal Design is <strong>choosing</strong> who will
          struggle or be left out. Designing with Universal Design is a way to
          say: “Everyone belong here, and this experience was built with all in
          mind.”
