        Definition and principles of Universal Design
      </h2>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
          Universal Design is the design of products and environments to be
          usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the
          need for adaptation or specialized design. On the web, this means
          building sites that work for people with different bodies, senses,
          devices, languages, and attention spans.

        <h3>Universal Design, accessibility, and inclusive design</h3>
        <p>
          These ideas overlap, but they are not exactly the same:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Universal Design</strong> aims for one design that works for as many people as possible.</li>
          <li><strong>Accessibility</strong> focuses on meeting specific requirements so people with disabilities can use a product.</li>
          <li><strong>Inclusive design</strong> is the process of involving diverse
              people in design and testing, and learning from their experiences.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This project uses all three: Universal Design as the goal, accessibility
          standards as the guardrails, and inclusive design as a mindset.

        <h3>The 7 principles of Universal Design</h3>
        <p>Universal Design is often summarized with seven principles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Equitable use:</strong> the design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Flexibility in use:</strong> it accommodates a wide range of preferences and abilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Simple and intuitive:</strong> it is easy to understand, regardless of experience or concentration level.</li>
          <li><strong>Perceptible information:</strong> it communicates information effectively, regardless of sensory abilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Tolerance for error:</strong> it minimizes hazards and the negative consequences of mistakes.</li>
          <li><strong>Low physical effort:</strong> it can be used comfortably, with minimal fatigue.</li>
          <li><strong>Size and space for approach and use:</strong> it provides appropriate space for approach, reach, and manipulation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>WCAG’s POUR principles</h3>
        <p>
          On the web, accessibility standards are often summarized as “POUR”:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Perceivable:</strong> users can perceive the content in at least one way (for example, text alternatives for images).</li>
          <li><strong>Operable:</strong> users can navigate and interact with all controls (keyboard, switch devices, etc.).</li>
          <li><strong>Understandable:</strong> content and interfaces are clear, predictable, and consistent.</li>
          <li><strong>Robust:</strong> content works with a wide range of browsers, devices, and assistive technologies.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article class="content-section">
        <h3>Common barriers on the web</h3>
        <p>
          When Universal Design is not considered, users run into the same barriers repeatedly:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Low color contrast that makes text hard to read.</li>
          <li>Navigation that only works with a mouse and not with a keyboard.</li>
          <li>Images without alternative text, so screen reader users miss information.</li>
          <li>Buttons and links that are too small to tap on a phone.</li>
          <li>Motion and animation that cannot be reduced and can cause distraction or motion sickness.</li>
          <li>Time-limited tasks that advance before someone can finish.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Universal Design treats these issues as bugs in the design, not as
          “edge cases” that users should just deal with.
